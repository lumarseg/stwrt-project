## Scope

This project is releated to Design and build a 6DOF Motion Platform (Stewart Platform) and its Digital Twin, using Arcadia's MBSE methodology and the Capella tool. Additionally, good practices described in "NASA System Engineering Handbook", "INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook A Guide for System Life Cycle Processes and Activities" and Model-Based Requirements Engineering" will be taken as a reference.
